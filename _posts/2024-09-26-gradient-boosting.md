### Gradient Boosting
Gradient Boosting is an ensemble learning method, meaning it uses multiple models to improve its predictive performance. By training weak learner models
iteratively, it seeks to improve performance by correcting the residuals in the previous model. The final prediction is the sum of all the individual predictions.

Gradient Boosting can be prone to overfitting, so it's important to consider [something lmao].

In this particular implementation,  locally weighted regression method (Lowess class), and that allows a user-prescribed number of boosting steps.
