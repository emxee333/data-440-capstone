From the syllabus: "For research in data science, we use probability, statistics, linear algebra, theory of algorithms, optimization, and computer science to create systems that can parse through large amounts of
data at high speeds and make automated predictions and decisions with or without human
supervision. This course will introduce students to advanced topics in machine learning, and
research methods for data analysis. This course emphasizes research, communication skills, and
independent inquiries. Students are expected to identify and analyze a data set of choice, conduct
independent research, apply the appropriate methods they learned, and synthesize the results in a
professional paper format."
